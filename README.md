# `Vanilla Commerce - OOTB SAP Commerce for Demos`
This project is used for the Vanilla Commerce Demo System. It is a totally OOTB SAP Commerce which will be daily deployed to una.sybit.de
It can be used to see which features OOTB SAP Commerce offers. So you can play with it and you can not destry anything as it will be initialized every day!
The target group are interested people who would like to see how some features are working in the OOTB SAP Commerce e.g. Classification or Personalization.
So this system is specially for PO's which don't want (or can't) setup a local instance.
